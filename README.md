## Introduction
Zombieland is a first person (splitscreen probably) zombie - survival shooter. This game is a work-in-progress project developed by a single person. The game is based on survival mode, where the player has to face off against hordes of zombies that follow and try to kill them. The game currently features a basic gameplay on which will be built all planned features. The game has several features planned for future releases, including new game modes, maps, and mechanics.

## Installation
To run the game, you need to have Unity installed on your computer. Once you have Unity installed, you can clone or download the repository and open it in Unity. Once you have the project open, you can run it in the Unity editor or build it to play on your device.

## How to Play
The player's objective is to survive against the waves of zombies that come at them. The zombies will try to reach the player, and the player must use their weapon to kill them before they get too close. The game also will feature several collectibles that can be used to aid the player in their survival. The game will also feature a level-up system, allowing the player to improve their abilities as they progress.

## Technologies Used
The game was developed using the Unity game engine. The developer used various assets from other creators which will be replaced before full release (if I find any graphics designer - if you are reading this and you are communicate with me: theodorgeor@gmail.com). The game will also feature a weather system that can affect the player's visibility and mobility. Additionally, the game will include a crafting system, where the player can use resources found from killing zombies to craft weapons, aid kits, traps, fortifications, and ammo.

## Planned Features
The game is still a work-in-progress, and the developer plans to add several features in future releases. These features include:

* New maps of varying sizes
* A weather system that affects the player's visibility and mobility
* A crafting system that allows the player to create weapons, aid kits, traps, fortifications, and ammo
* A level-up system that allows the player to improve their abilities as they progress
* New game modes, including a survival mode with fixed waves, a mode where the player has to rescue other survivors and recruit them, a mode where the player has to find a cure, a mode where the player has to reach the exit of an exclusive map, a mode where the player has a limited time to survive, and a mode with unlimited waves.
* Different types of zombies with unique abilities
* The ability to choose different characters with different abilities
* A game mode where the player can play in split-screen cooperative mode
* A game mode where the game ends on fixed time and zombies search for him instead of just following him

## Conclusion
Thank you for your interest in my 3D Unity game. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it. I welcome any feedback and suggestions for future releases.
